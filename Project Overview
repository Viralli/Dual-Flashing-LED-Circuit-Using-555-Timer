Project Overview: Dual Flashing LED Circuit Using 555 Timer

Overview

    The Dual Flashing LED Circuit utilizes the 555 Timer IC to create a visually engaging signal display. Configured in astable mode, the 555 Timer generates a continuous 

     square wave signal that alternates the blinking of two LEDs. This project effectively demonstrates the principles of oscillation, timing, and pulse-width modulation in a 
 
    straightforward and practical manner.

Project Description

    In this project, the 555 Timer IC is employed to drive two LEDs in an alternating flashing pattern. By configuring the timer in its astable mode, a square wave signal is 

    produced, with the frequency and duty cycle of the oscillation determined by the associated resistors and capacitor. The 270Ω resistor limits the current through the LEDs,

    while the 1kΩ and 10kΩ resistors, along with the 100μF capacitor, set the timing intervals for the LED flashes. The inclusion of 1N4007 diodes provides protection against 

    reverse voltage, ensuring circuit reliability. The project demonstrates the interaction of these components to achieve a desired visual effect, offering a practical 

    application of basic electronic principles.
