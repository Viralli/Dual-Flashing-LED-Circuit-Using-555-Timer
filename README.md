# Dual-Flashing-LED-Circuit-Using-555-Timer

    This project involved designing and implementing a dual flashing LED circuit using a 555 Timer IC. The circuit was designed to achieve alternating blinking of two LEDs through a continuous square wave signal generated by 

    the 555 Timer. The project included transitioning from initial breadboard testing to final Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly.
