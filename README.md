# Dual-Flashing-LED-Circuit-Using-555-Timer

# Introduction

   This project showcases the practical application of the 555 Timer in its astable mode to generate an alternating LED blinking pattern. The primary objective is to 
   
   demonstrate the fundamental principles of pulse-width modulation and timing circuits in a clear and visually engaging manner.

  
   The 555 Timer IC, renowned for its versatility and reliability, is configured to produce a continuous square wave signal that alternates the operation of two LEDs. This 
   
   circuit is an excellent example of how timing and oscillation principles can be applied to create simple yet effective electronic devices. By adjusting the resistors 
   
   and capacitor in the circuit, users can explore how different component values influence the timing intervals and frequency of the LED flashes.
